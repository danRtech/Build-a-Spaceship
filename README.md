# ðŸ“Œ Build a Spaceship with Spring Boot Microservices
> Welcome to the Spring Boot 3 Microservices Project! This repository is a hands-on implementation of microservices using Spring Boot 3, along with several other essential technologies for modern backend development.


## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack
- âœ… Spring Boot 3 - The core framework for building microservices.
- âœ… Spring Data & Spring Data REST - Simplified data access and RESTful APIs.
- âœ… Spring MVC - Model-View-Controller architecture for handling web requests.
- âœ… JUnit & Mockito - Unit testing to ensure robust application functionality.
- âœ… SpringBootTest - Integration testing of Spring Boot applications.
- âœ… Docker - Containerization for easy deployment and scalability.
- âœ… MongoDB - NoSQL database integration.
- âœ… Spring Security - Authentication and authorization for securing microservices.
- âœ… Spring Cloud - Tools for building distributed and scalable microservices.

## âš¡ Quick Start
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- Java 17+ (Recommended for Spring Boot 3)
- Maven 3+ (For dependency management)
- Docker (For containerized deployment)
- MongoDB (If using locally)

### Run the project
Since all the required dependencies are added into pom.xml, just do the following:

- Copy the project as ZIP from this GitHub repository into your machine.
- Unzip it and open with IntelliJ IDEA (or your favourite IDE).
- Find the SpaceshipDataApplication.java class at the root of "spaceship-data" component and run its main() method.
- Verify the project is up and running and there are no errors in the console.
- Open Swagger in your favourite browser (http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/) and examine the RESTful API Endpoints.
